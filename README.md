Your README.md should have a separate heading for each documentation requirement and answers organised under the appropriate headings.

R4	Provide a link to your source control repository	

Design a Software Development Plan for a terminal application. The following requirements provide details of what needs to be included in this plan

### Github

https://github.com/RaDevy/RajeshRanjith

### Trello

https://trello.com/b/xxFlbYij/terminal-application

R5	Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:

- describe at a high level what the application will do
>>> Helps people get better sleep hygeine

- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
>>> Bad sleeping habits

- identify the target audience
>>> Gamers, artist, 14-30 (anyone with bad sleeping patterns)

- explain how a member of the target audience will use it
>>> Fill out a questionaire that will aid them in better sleeping patterns. Returns a score that predicts their sleep

300 - 500 words

R6	Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

>>> Menu
>>> Caffeine intake
>>> BMI
>>> Screentime
>>> Psychological questions

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
 >>> use of variables and the concept of variable scope
 >>> loops and conditional control structures
 >>> error handling

Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .	300 words (approx. 100 words per feature)

R7	Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
 >>> how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
    - TTY prompt lets the user know what they need to do to interact with the input.
    - My application 
 >>> how the user will interact with / use each feature
    - This is a linear questinaire that takes the step by step
    - Each question prompts the user with instructions
 >>> how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user	
    - If the user inputs the incorrect datatype the terminal prompts to not do that and enter the correcr data type
    - This will be done with the BEGIN - RESCUE - error handling method

R8	Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:

![Control Flow Diagram](docs/ControlFLowDiagram.png)

- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.	

R9	Develop an implementation plan which:

>>> List out your features

Main app - 8days
    - Menu
    - Caffeine Questionaire
    - BMI 
    - Psychology
    - Screen Time
    - Final Advice
    - Polish/Bug fixing

1. Caffeine Questionaire (3hrs)
    - Initialize Questionaire class
    - Plan out the questions that I need to ask the user
    - Figure what what TTY-Prompt is most suitable for that type of question
    - Write up the question flow 
    - Impliment it into the menu

- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.
R10	Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements

>>> Powerpoint - 

>>> A walk-through of your Terminal application, its features and how it used

>>> A walk-through of the logic of your Terminal application and code

>>> A review of your development/build process including challenges, ethical issues, favourite parts, etc
